Pacific Coast Highway. One of the first sounds you hear in “Champagne Supernova” by Oasis is water – the sound of it churning, flowing, crashing on the shore – and it always makes me think of PCH. It makes me remember driving alongside miles and miles of beaches at night the time we decided to extend our drive by half an hour just to take the scenic route home. We listened to “Champagne Supernova” in silence as you drove, and I was happy – really happy – but I cried. 

> How many special people change? / How many lives are living strange? / Where were you while we were getting high?

The first few lines of Champagne Supernova ask a lot of questions I don’t have the answer to. How many people, who were close to me at one point in my life, are now strangers? How many people are living in ways they themselves don’t understand, or in ways society can’t bring itself to accept? Where were you – no, where was I – when I should’ve been enjoying myself? Liam Gallagher’s voice echoes fears of the future and regrets of the past. 

Gallagher said even he doesn’t know what the next lyrics, “Slowly walking down the hall / Faster than a cannonball” really mean, but that they must mean something different to everyone to listens to them. 

> Slowly walking down the hall / Faster than a cannonball / Where were you while we were getting high?

The lines are reminiscent of the days which pass slowly and the years which pass altogether way too fast. It disorients me; leaves me feeling both like I’m drowning and like my toes have barely reached the water. Time is relentless, and she marches and she marches and she marches forward no matter how hard I will her to stop. 

Me, I march in place. More specifically, I like to march in circles. There’s a small traffic circle a few minutes from your house; we call it “The Globe” after the metal statue of a globe in the center, surrounded by a small sidewalk. The streets which are connected by it are small and industrial; a quiet shortcut we use on our way to study at the local Starbucks. It’s a shortcut but it’s also a detour – every time we drive through that road we circle around that empty traffic circle, circle around The Globe 2, 3, sometimes 4 or 5 times. Driving, driving, driving but going nowhere, just for fun and just because we can. We went there with friends the night we graduated high school, except this time we parked and walked laps around The Globe instead, a strange symbolic ritual we felt necessary at that point in our lives.  

> Wake up the dawn and ask her why / A dreamer dreams, she never dies / Wipe that tear away now from your eye

There are certain moments I wish I could crawl inside of and exist within forever. Moments where all your senses are heightened, and your surroundings are bolder than ever, but at the same time everything is muffled because nothing matters except where you are, who you’re with, and who you are right then and there. These pieces of existence express themselves in different ways – sometimes in the chirping of birds and the rustle of the trees and the warmth of the sun beating on my skin as I lay in the grass in silence with people I love, sometimes in a cackling laugh without a hint of restraint, sometimes in the way the air feels on chilly nights spent talking about hopes and dreams, sometimes in the soft raspiness of your voice when you’ve just woken up. And these moments scare me the most because in my happiness I know these moments will pass, that Time will continue her march and that no matter how happy I am, things will change and there’s nothing I can do about it. No matter how much I want to hide in between the notes of the way that song sounded on that night, soon you’ll go back to your school far away from my own. No matter how much I love who I am and where I’m at, I’ll be someone else, somewhere else soon. No matter how special someone is to me now, people change. There’s something about driving down PCH at night with the person you love, while listening to a song about how people come and go, that just brings tears. 

> The world’s still spinning around and we don’t know why / Why, why, why, why

I wish Time would march the same way we did around The Globe. I wish Time would pass a little slower – maybe take some detours, like when we walked around the neighborhood before getting in the car because it was nice out. I wish I would let myself be happy without feeling anxious about the future. Why, why, why, why do I do this to myself? 

> Someday you will find me / Caught beneath the landslide / In a champagne supernova in the sky

I’m not going to pretend I have any idea what the chorus of “Champagne Supernova” is supposed to mean. I think that’s why I like it so much. It hints at separation and reunion, being crushed under the weight of the earth but being up in space, freer than anything in the world. There’s something comforting in senselessness and contradiction. Being able to put your heart and soul into something – into someone – when you don’t know what the future holds is a risk people willingly throw themselves into every day.  

So I want to appreciate every day and I want to appreciate every person who is special to me now because I know that nothing is guaranteed. But I also want to believe in the fact that I am not a passive player in the flow of Time, and I want to believe that one day I can step off the sidewalk which circles The Globe, pick a road, and walk down it with you.
